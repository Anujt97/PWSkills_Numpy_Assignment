    "Question 1 :- What is a Python library? Why do we use Python libraries?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python library is a collection of pre-written code and functionalities that can be imported and used in Python programs to perform specific tasks without the need to write the code from scratch. These libraries typically contain functions, classes, and modules that offer solutions for common problems or provide tools to streamline development in various domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Python libraries for several reasons:\n",
    "1. Efficiency: Libraries save time and effort by providing ready-made solutions to common programming problems.\n",
    "2. Functionality: Libraries extend the capabilities of Python by offering a wide range of functionalities that aren't available in the core Python language.\n",
    "3. Specialization: Many Python libraries are specialized for specific tasks or domains. For example, there are libraries for web development (e.g., Flask, Django)."

    "Question 2 :- What is the difference between Numpy array and List?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays and Python lists are both used to store collections of data, but they have several key differences in terms of functionality, performance, and usage :\n",
    "1. Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays are more memory efficient compared to Python lists. This efficiency comes from NumPy arrays being homogeneous (all elements are of the same data type) and stored in contiguous memory blocks, while Python lists are heterogeneous and store references to objects in memory, leading to more overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* NumPy arrays generally offer better performance for numerical computations compared to Python lists. NumPy's underlying implementations are written in C, which allows for optimized operations and vectorized calculations.\n",
    "* Python lists are more flexible but slower, especially for large datasets and numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "* NumPy arrays come with a wide range of mathematical functions and operations optimized for numerical computing, such as element-wise operations, linear algebra operations, statistical functions, and random number generation.\n",
    "* Python lists provide more general-purpose functionality and are suitable for storing heterogeneous data types and performing basic list operations like appending, slicing, and concatenating."
